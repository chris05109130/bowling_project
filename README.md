Very First CSS Project I Made Ever

This project like mentioned above is my first project I ever made when dealing with CSS. Now this project has the old style method of laying out the elements which is using CSS Floats. 

This project was made because I was in school getting my bachelors degree in web development and I had to redesign a website of my choosing. My job had a website that to me is to cluttered so I wanted to do a redesign of there website

There site is www.bowlerama.us

Basically like mentioned this project was by using the CSS Float properties. But this project is more involved with laying out each page such as index, hours, leagues, and contact page.
